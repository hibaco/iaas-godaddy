<p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Kay brings cultural depth and perspective and is passionate about helping our students’ talented and gifted minds develop to their fullest potential.&nbsp; It is our belief that a fine preschool education is even more important than the education one receives in the primary and secondary years, given that the benefits resonate more deeply due to the intellectual and emotional influences of the formative years of early childhood.&nbsp;&nbsp; The children are given the freedom to play, explore and experiment, yet are afforded the structure to develop writing, mathematics, and languages in a friendly, positive atmosphere so that they are prepared for a successful transition into public school programs.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">IAAS is governed by a Board of Trustees.&nbsp; The Board is primarily responsible for carrying out the school's mission and insuring its long term financial, physical and educational viability by providing advice and counsel to the director and other school leaders.&nbsp; Board members are accomplished, distinguished members of the world of education, child psychology, business, law and beyond.&nbsp; They share a keen appreciation for the mission of the School, and, with their worldly perspective, they&nbsp; help assure that IAAS grows and adapts in ways that are tactically sound for the community that the school ultimately serves.&nbsp; The board meets once each year and gathers at other times as needed in smaller groups to address specific issues. &nbsp; </span></p>
