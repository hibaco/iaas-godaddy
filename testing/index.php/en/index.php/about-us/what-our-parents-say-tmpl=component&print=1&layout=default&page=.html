<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">"When my daughter entered IAAS in September, she did not speak English or Japanese, and only Korean.&nbsp; Without pushing her at all, she now speaks and reads English and Japanese, and to my amazement, she is now reading Korean at home because of all of the language skills (the basics of grammar and phonics) she has learned at school. &nbsp; At home, she likes to say, "Mommy is a math teacher, my big brother is the English teacher, and I am the Japanese teacher!" with great pride.&nbsp; We are so thrilled by what this school has done for her."&nbsp; -M.K., Closter</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">"As a parent of a multicultural child, it was very clear to me that my child would need to acquire a second language as early as possible.&nbsp; I enrolled my son to fulfill our family’s needs of a bilingual education, but I was happily surprised to find that the program was filled with fun activities and events.&nbsp; My son enjoyed going to the zoo with his friends and teachers and riding the train; he had a glimpse of Japanese culture when the school had a tea ceremony master come and provide his first sip of green tea. He likes singing songs in music class and practicing karate katas with a black-belt karate master.&nbsp; IAAS is a very unique and special preschool full of classes and events where kids can learn and enjoy naturally."&nbsp; –R.R., Montclair</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">"My daughter graduated IAAS in 2010, and now my son enjoys going to school every day.&nbsp; Being in a bilingual environment helped them to maintain their first language in Japanese as well as improve their second language in English.&nbsp; When my daughter entered the public school kindergarten in the fall, she had no problem adjusting to the new school and making friends.&nbsp; IAAS offers music, dance, karate classes by professional teachers, so it is an "all-in-one" school.&nbsp; The events are all carefully prepared and I am always amazed by how hard the teachers work for the school and children.&nbsp; My daughter especially enjoyed Broadway Kids when she performed in "Beauty and the Beast" during the summer of 2010.&nbsp; After nearly a year, my children still ask me to play the soundtrack and sing along."&nbsp; –T.I., Fort Lee </span></p>

Milk cartons are reused as planters; toilet paper cardboard is used to make binoculars.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">6.&nbsp; My child comes home and talks about the myriad of things (the leaves, trees) she finds beautiful. (She never did this when attending her previous preschool.)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">7.&nbsp; The teachers always use positive reinforcement and subtle sign language to show what is correct and what is not.&nbsp; They are also very thorough in explaining both regular instruction and the cause and effect of actions and words. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">8. After 2 months, my child was well on her way to becoming fluent in proper Japanese.&nbsp; (I speak to her in both Japanese and English, my husband speaks to hear in English, and so she spoke very little Japanese in the beginning of the year.)&nbsp; Read about the benefits of learning a second (or third) language in “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/science/31conversation.html?_r=2&src=ISMR_HP_LO_MST_FB" target="_blank _mce_href=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/science/31conversation.html?_r=2&amp;src=ISMR_HP_LO_MST_FB">The Bilingual Advantage</a>.”</span><br /></p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">9.&nbsp; The principal/founder is an expert on language acquisition and values education at every level and in subject matters across the board.&nbsp; She teaches the Whales and the Saturday Asunaro class.&nbsp; She also stops in to read to every class throughout the school year. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">10.&nbsp; Educational reports show that a high quality preschool education results in higher achievement and fewer problems later on in life.&nbsp; (*See NPR story below) </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">11.&nbsp; Children who may have been restless with pent up energy work with purpose. They are soon able to explain what they are doing and what they have achieved.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">12.&nbsp; The teachers really give the children the opportunity to explore, and are delighted when they act upon their curiosity.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">13.&nbsp; If a child is about to do something dangerous or risky, the teachers are quick to instruct and warn the child in detail. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">14.&nbsp; The family is the child’s 1st community.&nbsp; The school is often his or her 2nd community.&nbsp; The school has a tremendous sense of community because of the way it celebrates and validates many nations and cultures. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">15.&nbsp; The teachers speak to the children and one another with kindness, respect and warmth.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">16.&nbsp; The other parents/guardians are friendly and it is inspiring to watch them communicate with their children. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">17.&nbsp; There is a forest, library and museum right next to the school if the children want to explore any of them.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">18.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowhere else will the child receive a handmade birthday card from her teachers AND another one from her principal and the assistant director.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">19.&nbsp; We presently live in a time where music and art programs are being completely cut out of schools in both Bergen County, New Jersey, and the United States in general.&nbsp; So while some preschools have a music teacher that visits the class once or twice a week, the children at IAAS have music daily.&nbsp; While other schools seem to have anxiety about funding the Arts, this school seems to be shouting, We Celebrate Music and Dance! </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">20.&nbsp; The annual holiday concert and art exhibit are always described by parents as being “out of this world.” </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">21.&nbsp; The school celebrates imagination. The school allows the children to work as a team to build enormous sculptures.&nbsp; This year the children made a giant elephant (Elmer), giraffe and zebra for its Africa themed art exhibition.&nbsp; I was also impressed that the school kept it in the Arts room as a testimony to remind the children: You can do anything!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">22.&nbsp; The teachers often work overtime for special events (creating costumes and preparing) for the benefit of the children and their families.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">23.&nbsp; At the once/month birthday party, the children get to try a different ethnic food together, followed by cake.&nbsp; It is amazing to watch the children gobble up different foods with their friends. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">24.&nbsp; The principal/founder is proud of the children for learning the word for “moussaka” during the month that Greece was celebrated. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">25.&nbsp; Parents can correspond with teachers on a daily basis through the use of a notebook that is kept in the child’s backpack. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">26.&nbsp; The teachers take every precaution to make sure that the children are safe.&nbsp; They even do not wear accessories to prevent snagging or harm.&nbsp; Decorations that might snag are never placed at a child’s eye level. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">27.&nbsp; My child is now telling me strictly (but gently) when I am not minding my manners at the dinner table. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">28. The children who attend are articulate and interesting. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">29. There are early drop-off and late pick-up options for working parents like me.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">30.&nbsp; The school openly welcomes the whole family. There are programs that my 1-year old can enjoy (free mommy &amp; me; baby rhythms class; sitting in on her sister’s piano lessons with Miss Manami.)&nbsp; There is a ballet and jazz dance program for the caregivers after drop-off, with a babysitter in attendance if necessary.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">31.&nbsp; Rather than simply being tolerant of different people from different lands, the school actively celebrates and welcomes the notion of difference.&nbsp; A deep question that might occur in the children’s heads might be, “What does it mean to be different?”&nbsp; We live in a plural society in the Tri-State/ Metropolitan area, and this teaches both empathy and self-acceptance. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">32.&nbsp; My daughter loves school so much that she waits by the car in subzero weather for me to get ready and open up the car.&nbsp; Her eyes shine as brightly at the end of the school year as they did in September.</span><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">"</span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;">- A.S., Mahwah<br /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-small;">*Excerpt from <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128328858" target="_blank _mce_href=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128328858">NPR</a>, July 6, 2010</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-small;">BEARDSLEY: Experts say the focus on cognitive and emotional development at the same time is what makes a good preschool. Miho Taguma is an education specialist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. She says long -term studies show that children who attend high quality preschool programs achieve more and have fewer problems later on.</span><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-small;">Ms. MIHO TAGUMA (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development): It's not only the parents and the child who benefit from the participation of preschool, but also that society as a whole. We consider public spending in early children is not a cost, but an investment in the future - important for economic development and ensuring well-being of the nation.</span><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-small;" _mce_style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-small;">BEARDSLEY: Some economists estimate that investing in early education for some groups produces a return of nearly six to one in benefits and savings later on. Taguma says France and the Nordic nations invest the most in early childhood education, while her native Japan has a poor record. The U.S. is not spending enough either, she says, but it is at least targeting lower income children with its Head Start program.</span><br /></p>
