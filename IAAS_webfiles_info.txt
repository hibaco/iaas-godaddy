English site: The main html files are in the index.php folder. The style sheets and images are nested within the testing folder.

Japanese site: The japanese html files are in the index.php>jp folder. The style sheets and images are linked to the template and image folders directly from the root. 

Additional notes: 
oldsite_backup contains all the files from the site before the summer of 2013.
The significant style sheets are within the templates>theme_kids0164-2>css folder.
